Mostly in regards to stuff like interests and likes and dislikes. It‚Äôs like I only get into popular things in order to keep up with trends and impress people. I don‚Äôt have my own taste in things.

Like I‚Äôve watched every Marvel movie even though I don‚Äôt really like them. 

I feel like my identity is just copying other people and trying to like what is popular. I don‚Äôt know what I actually like. I think a lot of this comes from a fear of being labelled when I was younger. I was so desperate not to be labelled as a particular thing like an emo or a hipster that I ended up not developing any identity at all. I was really sensitive to criticism as well, like I used to love Twilight but then people started making fun of it so I pretended I never liked it.

I don‚Äôt have much of a social circle due to years of social anxiety and depression which I think affects my identity since I don‚Äôt have many outside influences. However, I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve been starting to mimic my boyfriend‚Äôs interests lately which I think is really unhealthy but I think I‚Äôm doing it because I don‚Äôt have my own identity.
