I hate listing all of these things that I've been diagnosed with because I don't see the point in putting labels on all of it. But one struggle I will label as anxiety.

 Some background info: recent college grad with a horrible family background. Lots of fighting, animosity, parents holding money and their love/acceptance over my head. Usually having to do with who I'm dating. 

Current situation on that: dating a guy who is 15 years older than me. I will admit our relationship is questionable in the sense that we have had our ups and downs, moments where I question if this is what I want and how I want to be treated. I could make a separate post about this but I'm going to spare everyone those details lol.  But at the same time, he's my best friend, no one has ever made me laugh like he does and he provides a huge sense of support that I feel I don't have anywhere else. Sometimes I feel like I would fucking crumble apart without him. I'm a mess. Mom hasn't spoken to me and has cut me off completely due to his age so I spent Christmas alone while my boyfriend had to work. This aspect has sent me into a deep depressive hole. 

I've always had issues making and keeping satisfying friendships. I'm not gonna be stupid and try and say that everyone else is the problem, when most of the evidence points to myself. However sometimes I don't think I'm the best at picking em. Im extremely afraid to put myself out there or hangout with a friend one on one. I feel like I'm uninteresting and awkward. This causes me to only ask friends to do surface level things like go out for a drink or things like that. So that hopefully they won't notice how awkward and stupid I am. I often feel that my friends don't care about me. I think they only care about what I can give them or do for them. I get jealous really easily in friendships too, or my feelings hurt very easily, but I don't dare express it. I just hide it and distance myself. Maybe I'm afraid of caring too much because I feel like I'm always the one that loves more than others. If you haven't gathered by reading this I'm very afraid of being alone. Terrified. When I'm alone these thoughts of all of the things that are wrong with me keep circling around my head. Everything I ever said or did wrong or embarrassing. I just feel like I'm a mistake. 

These types of relationship issues whether it's a bf, parents, or friends have been prominent throughout my life. I've been on meds, seen multiple therapists. I have one right now but I feel we've gotten to the point that he thinks I'm fine. And Everytime I go in there I have a hard time telling him that I'm struggling way more than he thinks I am. Just really want to learn how to be happy. How to love myself. How to have happy and healthy relationships. I understand I should make some changes. I'm not sure what. 

If you have some helpful advice please let me know. Keep in mind I'm a sensitive Sally so anything you say I will take to heart lol."

She also wanted to cut all communication and act like I no longer exist. A few weeks later my Dad started to take ill health and he passed away a few weeks ago. Him and I were extremely close. I went to tell my ex as her and my Dad really were fond of each other and I thought she deserved to know. I literally just spent 2 mins telling her about Dad, and didn’t mention “us” or anything beyond my Dads passing. A few hours later she messaged saying I’m no longer part of her life and she doesn’t care what happens in my life and that if I see or contact her again she’ll get the police onto me.

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non- invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires, two neuroimaging sessions, and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS.
Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

Alrighty. For my first post imma talk about this weird feeling I have literally 24/7. First of all, I fucking hate it. Anyways, so all the time I have this feeling that I’m being watched??? This feeling has been persistent for about 6years now I think. I don’t really remember when it started.  And it’s not that anxious feeling you get like in public where a stranger might be watching you or something creepy, it’s like, people I know, the people change over time as they come and go irl but it feels like people I look up to or want to impress or just don’t want to disappoint are watching me. Like, when I’m laying down, when I shower, use the restroom, walk, in class at school or just doing anything. It kinda feels like I’m always putting on a performance because of this, always perfect posture when I walk, never slouching or laying down on the couch in an unflattering way, never eating food messily or impolitely even when I’m alone. Because the people are watching me. I know no ones actually watching me cause the technology my mind makes up to make such things happen don’t actually exist that I know of. I thought that maybe this is what being paranoid is so I googled it (I know I know, not the best method of research) but all the symptoms aren’t it. It says symptoms of PPD are things like being quick to anger, defensive, and thinking that people are going to hurt you. I’ve never felt that someone would hurt me, not even strangers on the street! And I’ve never just been quick to anger with people unless they straight up do some wack shit like continue talking to me when I’ve said to stop, standing too close or touching when I’ve repeatedly said to stop or just straight up being a dick/homophobic/sexist.

About 6 years ago my wife started a new job and things we’re great we welcomed our second child in 15. From 2018 this started to change where she felt her boss was doing shady stuff(she works with financial stuff). Then she started to tell me the office was bugged and that her phone may even be bugged. It was never real serious but she felt she needed to leave.

Last year she left for a new company and better pay, this was in February I think. About may it started again that the company was out to get her or set her up to be fired. I wanted her to talk to someone but she refuses to see and medical doctor. 

September she told me she was looking for a new job and I was understanding but I just wanted her to take her time and not just jump at the first thing. 

Very fist interview she was offered a job with way less pay but a lot closer to home. She accepted right away and explained that she felt she needed this.

At this point I didn’t know what to do since she won’t talk with anyone about her thoughts. She thinks this company has deep connection with religious and government secrets. She confronted her boss about it Saturday.  Today I find out she was fired for harassment. 

She wants to work on stuff like feng shui and essential oils but she won’t talk with anyone.

FUCK, where is my passion? Jesus Christ, where is my fight?

Maybe I had hope for tomorrow, but right now I can't see the sunrise.


I can barely see the me of the future, I can hardly hear myself cry.

The tomorrow I thought would be nearer, in my head seems only a lie.


The further I reach for an answer, less is more and I'm starting to fray.

I thought the sun would be brighter and I thought this would all go away.


The clouds in my head are just darker, and the banks of my heart overflow.

You act like you get it, but quit it.  Because don't act like you actually know.


You can't stop a river that rages, so park your ass at the dam.

Maybe stop and listen a minute, instead of offering all the shit that you can.


I'm errording apart at the seams, the precipice creeps dangerously nearer, and nothing is ever the same.

I slide frighteningly close to the edges, and I fall because I've made my own cage.


Sleep, the sleep, it could come quicker. And the sun it could set everyday.

A rainbow may shine in the darkess, but a dream is just a dream anyway.


My heart will always hurt harder, and tears will fall in each frame.  

It's been a picture I tried to master, in a life that was harder to tame.


Unhappy, unhappy is unhappy.  Change my ""attitude"" was all you could say.


Step back for a second and ponder. Christ,

please shut up your goddamn face.  It would never help me, or ANYONE, so swallow that fucking cliche."
