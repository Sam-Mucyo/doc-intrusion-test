So pretty much, I am feeling myself slowing going back into depression. I work a really good job and make really good money. However it's in the service industry, I'm a barber. So, things have been incredibly slow this week and my everything is starting to suffer because of it. I know a lot will have the thought of why don't you have savings. I do, just not a lot. I have had this job a little over a year and a half so, I have been replacing old things, moved etc... I have been applying for other jobs in case when/if my shop gets closed down. I am just so worried about what I'm going to do if I am jobless for any amount of time. My landlords are understanding but, other things are still worrying me. I lapsed a month back in the fall with my medicine, just birth control but it helps with depression, hormones etc... I fell into a terrible depression when I started taking it again and it lasted months. I am so worried I won't be able to afford it for even just a month. I don't know if I can handle a depression fall for that long again. Anyways, not really sure what I am wanting out of this or if it should be as big of a worry as I am making it. Thanks in advance for anyone taking the time to read this, I think typing this out has helped some.",

I started working a new job in January and I thought I would be used to it by now but all I do is lay in bed exhausted after work.

It's a more physically demanding job (working full time in a grocery store) than I'm used to and I'm coming off working around a hundred-twenty hours a week for four years (oh college). I figured it would take a while to feel well-rested again but it's been a really long time so I'm nervous perhaps my mental health is in a worse place than I thought.

It's like I only get into popular things in order to keep up with trends and impress people. I don't have my own taste in things. My music taste is all just a range of popular stuff like Radiohead, Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar. And sometimes I feel like I force myself to listen to or watch things I don't actually enjoy. Like I've watched every Marvel movie even though I don't really like them. I feel like my identity is just copying other people and trying to like what is popular. I don't know what I actually like. I think a lot of this comes from a fear of being labelled when I was younger. I was so desperate not to be labelled as a particular thing like an emo or a hipster that I ended up not developing any identity at all. I was really sensitive to criticism as well, like I used to love Twilight but then people started making fun of it so I pretended I never liked it. I don't have much of a social circle due to years of social anxiety and depression which I think affects my identity since I don't have many outside influences. However, I've noticed I've been starting to mimic my boyfriend's interests lately which I think is really unhealthy but I think I'm doing it because I don't have my own identity. Has anyone else had this problem? How can I find out who I am?",

Whenever something happens, there's always this little voice in my head that starts to tell me negative stuff. I basically have an argument with this irrational voice, trying to reassure myself and tell it it's wrong. But I rarely win these arguments. It causes me unnecessary pain to myself and others and I'm worried I'm going to push the people I love away.

I hate listing all of these things that I've been diagnosed with because I don't see the point in putting labels on all of it. But one struggle I will label as anxiety. Some background info: recent college grad with a horrible family background. Lots of fighting, animosity, parents holding money and their love/acceptance over my head. Usually having to do with who I'm dating. Current situation on that: dating a guy who is 15 years older than me. I will admit our relationship is questionable in the sense that we have had our ups and downs, moments where I question if this is what I want and how I want to be treated. I could make a separate post about this but I'm going to spare everyone those details lol. But at the same time, he's my best friend, no one has ever made me laugh like he does and he provides a huge sense of support that I feel I don't have anywhere else. Sometimes I feel like I would fucking crumble apart without him. I'm a mess. Mom hasn't spoken to me and has cut me off completely due to his age so I spent Christmas alone while my boyfriend had to work. This aspect has sent me into a deep depressive hole. I've always had issues making and keeping satisfying friendships. I'm not gonna be stupid and try and say that everyone else is the problem, when most of the evidence points to myself. However sometimes I don't think I'm the best at picking em. Im extremely afraid to put myself out there or hangout with a friend one on one. I feel like I'm uninteresting and awkward. This causes me to only ask friends to do surface level things like go out for a drink or things like that. So that hopefully they won't notice how awkward and stupid I am. I often feel that my friends don't care about me. I think they only care about what I can give them or do for them. I get jealous really easily in friendships too, or my feelings hurt very easily, but I don't dare express it. I just hide it and distance myself. Maybe I'm afraid of caring too much because I feel like I'm always the one that loves more than others. If you haven't gathered by reading this I'm very afraid of being alone. Terrified. When I'm alone these thoughts of all of the things that are wrong with me keep circling around my head. Everything I ever said or did wrong or embarrassing. I just feel like I'm a mistake. These types of relationship issues whether it's a bf, parents, or friends have been prominent throughout my life. I've been on meds, seen multiple therapists. I have one right now but I feel we've gotten to the point that he thinks I'm fine. And Everytime I go in there I have a hard time telling him that I'm struggling way more than he thinks I am. Just really want to learn how to be happy. How to love myself. How to have happy and healthy relationships. I understand I should make some changes. I'm not sure what. If you have some helpful advice please let me know. Keep in mind I'm a sensitive Sally so anything you say I will take to heart lol.",

                        text: "Treatment for Self-Injury through Research Study Thank you to the moderators of /r/MentalHealth for allowing me to post here! I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non- invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions. We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires, two neuroimaging sessions, and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures. If you are interested, please contact Young at 646-774-7603, or at young.cho@nyspi.columbia.edu. More information is also available at https://tdcsresearch.wordpress.com/.

To make your personal research results not be identifiable with you if they are used for publication in the scientific literature and presentation at scientific meetings, we will remove all your identifying information, including name and date of birth. Scan results, questionnaire answers, and data collected during the task may be used in future studies, and if shared with other investigators, information that identifies the scan, questionnaire responses, or task data with you will be removed before hand. There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality from such data sharing, but this is extremely low as only de-identified data from this study may be shared. Clinical records, including your name and other personal identifying information, and research data will be kept in secure storage at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Information in paper format will be kept in locked files.

Anyways, so all the time I have this feeling that I'm being watched??? This feeling has been persistent for about 6years now I think. I don't really remember when it started. And it's not that anxious feeling you get like in public where a stranger might be watching you or something creepy, it's like, people I know, the people change over time as they come and go irl but it feels like people I look up to or want to impress or just don't want to disappoint are watching me. Like, when I'm laying down, when I shower, use the restroom, walk, in class at school or just doing anything. It kinda feels like I'm always putting on a performance because of this, always perfect posture when I walk, never slouching or laying down on the couch in an unflattering way, never eating food messily or impolitely even when I'm alone. Because the people are watching me. I know no ones actually watching me cause the technology my mind makes up to make such things happen don't actually exist that I know of. I thought that maybe this is what being paranoid is so I googled it (I know I know, not the best method of research) but all the symptoms aren't it. It says symptoms of PPD are things like being quick to anger, defensive, and thinking that people are going to hurt you. I've never felt that someone would hurt me, not even strangers on the street! And I've never just been quick to anger with people unless they straight up do some wack shit like continue talking to me when I've said to stop, standing too close or touching when I've repeatedly said to stop or just straight up being a dick/homophobic/sexist. So if anyone wants to take a shot and guess at what the fuck this is I'm happy to listen :)",

From 2018 this started to change where she felt her boss was doing shady stuff(she works with financial stuff). Then she started to tell me the office was bugged and that her phone may even be bugged. It was never real serious but she felt she needed to leave. Last year she left for a new company and better pay, this was in February I think. About may it started again that the company was out to get her or set her up to be fired. I wanted her to talk to someone but she refuses to see and medical doctor. September she told me she was looking for a new job and I was understanding but I just wanted her to take her time and not just jump at the first thing. Very fist interview she was offered a job with way less pay but a lot closer to home. She accepted right away and explained that she felt she needed this. At this point I didn't know what to do since she won't talk with anyone about her thoughts. She thinks this company has deep connection with religious and government secrets. She confronted her boss about it Saturday. Today I find out she was fired for harassment. She wants to work on stuff like feng shui and essential oils but she won't talk with anyone. We have 2 kids together and I'm starting to get worried that this is getting worse and I have no idea what to do.",

But I'm sure that I am not functioning healthy. I regularly get really scared and in those moments I feel like absolute shit - recently learned that those are panic attacks. In general, I'm just really scared about everything, I try not to show it, but everytime I encounter a new situation, I get scared as fuck. People describe me as outgoing, self confident and beautiful, am I lying to myself? Why do I feel the exact opposite? I have to admit, when I'm drunk, I did hook up with random strangers (I regret nearly every night) - but I think I just wanted to feel loved. I was raped at a young age and maybe that has something to do with my whole mess. I don't know what to do anymore, a month ago I started to have physical complaints, I could not feel my left handy, leg and mouth anymore. Breathing seems so hard, my head hurts. I've been in the hospital for 4 days, but they said my body is in nearly perfect condition. Is it possibe that my mental health is affecting my body? Idk I feel super weird.",

I was put in a psych ward etc. Well fast forward to 2019. I was put on Latuda for my bipolar. Latuda was an absolute nightmare for me. The only way I can describe what I felt while taking Latuda was , restless yet tired and energy less. unable to think clearly (mind going a thousand miles per hour, my thoughts getting mixed up together) thankfully I stopped taking it and was put on Seroquel 2 months after I stopped taking Latuda. (SEROQUEL works amazing for me) But I still feel the effects of Latuda (unable to think clearly /getting my thoughts mixed up) Which never ever ever happened to me before I took Latuda. My therapist kind of talked about it a little bit and told me it was possible. since psych meds can be known to have long term effects. It puts me into a panic attack when I start to think about the long term effects. because I don't want my mind to jumble up thoughts together forever. I want to be able to think clearly like I was able to before Latuda. I know my therapist already told me this can happen. but I don't see her again till Monday. and idk what to do.

Maybe I had hope for tomorrow, but right now I can't see the sunrise. I can barely see the me of the future, I can hardly hear myself cry. The tomorrow I thought would be nearer, in my head seems only a lie. The further I reach for an answer, less is more and I'm starting to fray. I thought the sun would be brighter and I thought this would all go away. The clouds in my head are just darker, and the banks of my heart overflow. You act like you get it, but quit it. Because don't act like you actually know. You can't stop a river that rages, so park your ass at the dam. Maybe stop and listen a minute, instead of offering all the shit that you can. I'm errording apart at the seams, the precipice creeps dangerously nearer, and nothing is ever the same. I slide frighteningly close to the edges, and I fall because I've made my own cage. Sleep, the sleep, it could come quicker. And the sun it could set everyday. A rainbow may shine in the darkess, but a dream is just a dream anyway. My heart will always hurt harder, and tears will fall in each frame. It's been a picture I tried to master, in a life that was harder to tame. Unhappy, unhappy is unhappy. Change my \"attitude\" was all you could say. Step back for a second and ponder. Christ, please shut up your goddamn face. It would never help me, or ANYONE, so swallow that fucking cliche.",
